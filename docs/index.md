# Welcome to My Personal Homepage
## About Me
- 🎓 I’m a master student at FUNSOM, Soochow University(PRC).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computational chemistry.
- 📫 How to reach me: You are welcome to send me an [email](mailto:qhyu@stu.suda.edu.cn) if you have any questions.
- 😍 Life interests: Bike, GPU, HPC, Tennis🎾, Badminton🏸, OST🎶, Wood product craftsmanship🪵 and so on.

## My Research interests
My current research interests focus on **molecular dynamics** and its applications in **electrocatalytic dynamic processes**. Traditional electrocatalytic research is usually **static**, as dynamic process research methods represented by AIMD are **slow and expensive**. **Machine learning force field** is one of a solution to this dilemma. Recently, I have been studying the relationship between the **solvent structure** and catalytic activity at heterogeneous catalytic interfaces. At the same time, I am also interested in the combination of MLFF and **constant potential methods**. Welcome to contact me for more discussion.
